# The Long Drive - DropCam Tweak Mod

## Summary:

DropCam is a "Hidden Camera" that initially spawns exactly where your in-game camera is. This mod tweaks the way it behaves depending on which keys you hold before enabling it (Default = `F4`)

## Usage:

* Hold `Shift` to have the camera look at the player
* Hold `Ctrl` to have the player look at the camera
* Hold `Alt Gr` to have the camera zoom automatically (when following)
* Hold `Menu` to have the attach a light source at the camera

Additionally you can use the `Mouse3` and `Mouse4` (side buttons) to zoom in and out. (disables Auto Zoom)
